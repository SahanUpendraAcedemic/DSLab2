When hidden nodes increase

With very few hidden units (e.g., 1–2), the model is too simple → it underfits and accuracy is low.

With more hidden units (5–20), the model learns complex decision boundaries → accuracy improves significantly.

With too many hidden units (50+), the model may overfit → accuracy on training set is high but generalization can drop.

Pattern of accuracy

Accuracy increases at first as hidden nodes increase, since the network can capture more complex patterns.

After a certain point, accuracy plateaus or may fluctuate because of overfitting or saturation.
